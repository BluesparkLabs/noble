# Noble

A custom Drupal 8 theme developed from scratch based on the Drupal core *stable* theme, and adopting modern front-end development best practices including:

*   npm manages frontend packages and dependencies.
*   Gulp watches for frontend code changes and runs build tasks.
*   Sass (with SCSS syntax) for pre-css processing.
*   Sass partial structure roughly follows the [7-1 Pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern).
*   Autoprefixer for post-CSS processing adds vendor prefixes for cross-browser compatibility.
*   SCSS linting ensures code quality.
